<h1> Vanilla-Javascript-Hangman-Game </h1>
Pure Javavascript Hangman Game. Inspired by tutorial by simonjsuh.

I am currently in the process of adding to this to make the game my own. I intend to use this as a starting point to make my own version from scratch. 

I have currently only made a few simple changes such as replacing the game words, changing a variable or two and replacing the images shown with my own ones created in Adobe illustrator.
