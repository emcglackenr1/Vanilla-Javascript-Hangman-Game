<h1> Vanilla-Javascript-Hangman-Game </h1>
Pure Javavascript Hangman Game. Inspired by tutorial by simonjsuh.

I am currently in the process of adding to this to make the game my own. I intend to use this as a starting point to make my own version from scratch. 

I have currently only made a few simple changes to the art and code, such as replacing the game words, changing a variables and replacing the images shown with my own ones created in <b> Adobe illustrator</b>.
